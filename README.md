# Introduction to Deep Learning

This project was completed as part of my Master's program in Artificial Intelligence at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1. It is based on the practical work titled **"Introduction to Deep Learning"**. The goal of the project is to explore fundamental concepts of deep learning using the MNIST dataset and implement a perceptron model in PyTorch, focusing on essential techniques such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Files in the Repository

1. **`mnist.pkl.gz`**: The MNIST dataset in a compressed format.
2. **`perceptron_pytorch.py`**: A Python script implementing a perceptron model using PyTorch tensors for classification of the MNIST dataset.
3. **`IntroductionToDeepLearning.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook summarizing the practical work, including explanations, code execution, and results.

## Setup

### Running on Google Colab

1. Upload the provided files (`mnist.pkl.gz`, `perceptron_pytorch.py`, and `IntroductionToDeepLearning.ipynb`) to your Google Drive.
2. Open Google Colab and upload the `IntroductionToDeepLearning.ipynb` file.
3. Modify the file paths in the notebook to point to your Google Drive location.
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code.

## Usage

- The `perceptron_pytorch.py` script demonstrates a simple perceptron implementation using PyTorch. It includes training and evaluation on the MNIST dataset.
- The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the implementation, including data exploration, perceptron model building, and result visualization.
